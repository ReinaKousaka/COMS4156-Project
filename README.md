# project-tiger
## About
Project Tiger will offer data analytics for games and competitions. These analytics will be between records/milestones/statistics for each user that clients will host to general analytics regarding total user counts per day, week, month, etc. , most common winning strategies, and general overall user results. Basically, our server provides analytics for our clients to have access too.  
The clients will be organizations that host games and/or competitions. Basically, any client that desires analytics regarding competitive play and milestone tracking will be able to utilize our API. Our clients will be allowed to display this data for its users and they can decide which data to showcase publicly, privately per each of their users, or retain internally for research purposes. With regards to research purposes, our clients could be able to use information we provide to make decisions as to how to further develop their applications.  
The data we will be accumulating will be records/milestones per user (such as best result achieved, biggest bet won, biggest bet lost, total number of games, win-loss ratio). In order to keep track of these records, our server will store the username of all the users that our clients have. With regards to created data, our server can calculate the win-loss ratio and predict best possible move suggestions depending on which game is being played. The other forms of data are game logs, which contain metadata such as number of players, player ids, moves made, and money wagered. These game logs will be made accessible to all of our clientsâ€™ users to search for with game ids.  

### Build directions
```

```

## Libraries

#### curl, curlpp, asio
The program uses [libcurl](https://curl.se/libcurl/), [curlpp](https://github.com/jpbarrette/curlpp) and [asio](https://think-async.com/Asio/) for the network code and assumes that these are installed, they are not included in the project itself. The libraries are used in the client and server programs and are available under the Curl License, Boost Software License and MIT license, respectively.  
At present, curl and curlpp are also included in src/libraries, we may remove them in the future.

#### SQLite
[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is available in the src/libraries/sqlite folder. In its current form, it is the amalgamated source (i.e. all source files merged, which is the preferred distribution). SQLite is in the public domain. We use SQLite for the database class used by the server.

#### Crow
[Crow](https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow) is available in src/libraries/Crow. It is C++ framework for HTTP and Websocket web services with routing for the server. It is covered by a BSD-style license.

#### Openssl
[Openssl](https://github.com/janbar/openssl-cmake) is required by curl and included in the src/libraries/openssl-cmake folder. It is available under the OpenSSL License.

## Testing/Mocking
We use [GoogleTest and GMock](https://github.com/google/googletest), available in test/googletest. The libraries use a 3-Clause BSD license. Use `make run-tiger-test` to run the tests.  

## Tools for linting, static analysis etc.
#### Cpplint
We will be using cpplint, which enforces the [google style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). To install, run `pip3 install cpplint`.  
TODO: Google's style guide is pretty restrictive, so we'll disable some of the warnings later on, in particular for GNU extensions and some C-style constructs.


#### Cppcheck (static analysis)
Install [cppcheck](https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/) and run `cppcheck --enable=warning,style,unusedFunction <path to repo>`.  

#### Codespell (spelling)
Install [codespell](https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell) using `pip3 install codespell` and run `codespell <path to repo>` to find spelling mistakes.
